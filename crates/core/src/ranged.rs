//! RangedElement — a generic ranged annotation over the document's sequences.
//!
//! A [`RangedElement`] ties two anchors and a payload to a stable id, and lives in
//! a document-level set keyed by that id (not inside the sequence it annotates).
//! Each endpoint is a [`RangeAnchor`] — a [`RelativePosition`] inside a named
//! sequence — and the two endpoints may name *different* sequences, so a range can
//! span elements (a comment across paragraphs). Endpoints are fixed at create (a
//! re-range is delete + create); the payload is last-writer-wins. Marks, comments,
//! suggestions, and highlights are all conventions over this one primitive.
